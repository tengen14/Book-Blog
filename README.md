## Summary

This project tested my abilities with writing code on the backend and using MongoDB as a database.

The front end of this project was styled with Bootstrap and written with EJS, a templating engine that allows programmers to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. This format became worthwhile when dealing with Object IDs, as it made it simpler to render the correct data.

The back end was written in Node.js with Express. RESTful API calls are associated with separate routes. The schema for the data is written with Mongoose and connects the MongoDB database to the back end.

Overall, I really enjoyed this project as it allowed me to sharpen my backend skills. I also got a lot of experience using a database and experimenting with a new templating engine.
